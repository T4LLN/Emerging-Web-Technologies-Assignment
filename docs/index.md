### Who is James?
**Time at Durham College**
- I have attended Durham College in Oshawa a few times before
- I have only successfully completed a program once, which was for General Arts and Science
- Last year I dropped out of Computer Programmer mid-way through second semester, but learned so much along the way

**James' Past and future**
- I have been driving a car since I earned my license when I was 16
- I have never failed a driver test or exam
- I used to weight roughly 360 pounds three years ago, I am now down to 210 and feel great
- I envision myself designing the user interfaces of paintball markers for popular industry leaders like Planet Eclipse or Empire
- The future makes me nervous, but I know that great experiences and a fulfilling life is on the horizon


### What are some of James' hobbies?
**I enjoy playing Pokémon Go**
- I have been playing Pokémon Go on my Android phone since the game’s first release in 2016
- I accumulated 20 million experience reaching the max level of 40 about a year ago
- The games developers have increased the level cap to 50, and in the span of a month I am already level 42 
- I own a Bluetooth enabled, waterproof bracelet that automatically gathers resources in-game when I am not actively playing

**I have been playing paintball for 10+ years**
- I started off not knowing much about the sport
- I used to play at a field in Bowmanville, Ontario for years before it closed
- I own a high-end paintball marker that would double as a car payment if I chose to sell it (expensive gun)
- Note: *This does not include any of my other gear (ie. facemask, playing apparel, headbands, gloves, etc.)*
- My paintball marker has Bluetooth built into it as well
